\section {Summary}

I am a US citizen and small business owner with DoD security clearance and over 10 years of technical experience in various roles and pretty intense environments. I've been interested in computing and information security from an early age and am lucky enough now to get paid to have this kind of fun.\\\\I hope to continue progressing to new levels of competence in the infosec arena using the broad technical knowledge I have gained thus far as the underpinning.
